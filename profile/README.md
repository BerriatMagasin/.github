# 👨‍💻 Teo & Gabriel — Code, Collaboration & Innovation  

Hello and welcome! 👋  

We are **Teo Villet** and **Gabriel Halus**, two passionate developers, housemates, and tech enthusiasts who love building innovative projects—sometimes for fun, sometimes with a purpose.  

## What Drives Us  
- 🎯 Tackling complex technical challenges  
- ☕ Engaging discussions over coffee (or a well-deserved beer 🍻)  
- 🛠️ Exploring and experimenting with new technologies  
- 💡 Transforming simple ideas into fully realized projects  

## What We Do  
- Web applications, APIs, and personal development tools  
- Creative and experimental projects  
- Serious, production-grade solutions when the need arises  

## Why?  
Because we believe coding is more than just a skill—it’s a way of thinking, creating, and solving real-world problems.  
And doing it together? That’s where the real magic happens.
